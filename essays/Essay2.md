Before starting my first WOD assignment I was very unsure of myself because Professor Kazman was not there to guide me through the steps. I was also unsure of myself because the only other time I worked with coding was in ICS 101, and I was pretty confused for that portion of the class.

For BrowserHistory1, I honestly thought that 15 minutes was an ample amount of time, and that I would barely finish, but I was very, very, very wrong. I ended up getting stuck on the fourth and fifth step because I did not know where to place most of the tags. My first attempt consisted of me asking myself “Wait, does the h2 tag go in the head? Outside of the head?The Body?” or “Wait, what is a source tag?” Along with those struggles, I also noticed that I wasted most of my time trying to place the </p> at the end of a paragraph with my wrapped text setting disabled. After that miserable attempt, I watched the screen cast and tried again, and what felt like 10 minutes turned out to be 22 minutes. I tried one more time and completed the WOD with relief in about 14 and a half minutes. :)

BrowserHistory2 was definitely a lot easier and less tedious compared to BrowserHistory1. Even though it was less challenging, I still ran into minor issues. For example, even after watching the screencast I was still stuck for a very long time and ended up staring at my code for about 5 minutes wondering what was wrong with it because my style.css was not linked correctly. After another attempt and more blank stares, I finally realized that I incorrectly referenced my style.css. Turns out I named it style-css instead of style.css. 

BrowserHistory3 was also a lot easier compared to BrowserHistory1. Although it was easier, like BrowserHistory2, I still ran into some issues. When I tried that WOD for the first time I did not know how to get rid of the bullet points and make the navigation bar horizontal. I also struggled with the spacing of the columns. The combination of an ugly navigation bar, and poorly spaced columns made my webpage look hideous. I learned a lot from watching the screencast and fixed all the issues I encountered with ample time to spare.
