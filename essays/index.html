Hi everyone!! My name is Tyler Johnson, I am a Finance and Management Information Systems major, and I am a third-year student at UH MƒÅnoa! I grew up on the island of O'ahu and graduated from Kalani High school. After (hopefully) completing graduate school off island, I definitely want to move back to Hawai'i because I love living here. Some of my favorite pastimes include hiking, going to the beach, beach volleyball, and basically any outdoor activity.  

During my freshman year of college I initially thought that I was going to pursue Enviromental Engineering, but soon after I realized that I hated Calculus 3 and switched to Finance and MIS. I also decided to switch majors after hearing great things about Finance and MIS from my friends once I joined the American Marketing Association. I am disappointed that classes are now online due to COIVD-19, but I would like to get to know everyone and try to make this semester seem as normal as possible. :)
